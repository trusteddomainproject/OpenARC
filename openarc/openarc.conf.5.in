.SH NAME
.B openarc.conf
\- Configuration file for openarc

.SH LOCATION
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/openarc.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I openarc(8)
implements the
.B ARC
(Authenticated Received Chain)
specification for verifying authentication and handling of messages as
they are routed to their destinations.  This file is its configuration file.

Blank lines are ignored.  Lines containing a hash ("#") character are
truncated at the hash character to allow for comments in the file.

Other content should be the name of a parameter, followed by white space,
followed by the value of that parameter, each on a separate line.

For parameters that are Boolean in nature, only the first byte of
the value is processed.  For positive values, the following are accepted:
"T", "t", "Y", "y", "1".  For negative values, the following are accepted:
"F", "f", "N", "n", "0".

See the 
.I openarc(8)
man page for details about how and when the configuration file contents
are reloaded.

Unless otherwise stated, Boolean values default to "false", integer values
default to 0, and string and dataset values default to being undefined.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I AutoRestart (Boolean)
Automatically re-start on failures.  Use with caution; if the filter
fails instantly after it starts, this can cause a tight
.I fork(2)
loop.

.TP
.I AutoRestartCount (integer)
Sets the maximum automatic restart count.  After this number of
automatic restarts, the filter will give up and terminate.
A value of 0 implies no limit; this is the default.

.TP
.I AutoRestartRate (string)
Sets the maximum automatic restart rate.  If the filter begins restarting
faster than the rate defined here, it will give up and terminate.
This is a string of the form
.I n/t[u]
where
.I n
is an integer limiting the count of restarts in the given interval and
.I t[u]
defines the time interval through which the rate is calculated;
.I t
is an integer and
.I u
defines the units thus represented ("s" or "S" for seconds, the default;
"m" or "M" for minutes; "h" or "H" for hours; "d" or "D" for days).  For
example, a value of "10/1h" limits the restarts to 10 in one hour.  There
is no default, meaning restart rate is not limited.

.TP
.I Background (Boolean)
Causes
.I openarc
to fork and exits immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
The default is "true".

.TP
.I Canonicalization (string)
Selects the canonicalization method(s) to be used when signing messages.
When verifying, the message's ARC-Message-Signature: header field specifies
the canonicalization method.  The recognized values are
.I relaxed
and
.I simple
as defined by the DKIM specification.  The default is
.I relaxed/simple.
The value may include two different canonicalizations separated by a
slash ("/") character, in which case the first will be applied to the
header and the second to the body.

.TP
.I ChangeRootDirectory (string)
Requests that the operating system change the effective root directory
of the process to the one specified here prior to beginning execution.
.BR chroot (2)
requires superuser access. A warning will be generated if
.I UserID
is not also set.

.TP
.I EnableCoredumps (boolean)
On systems that have such support, make an explicit request to the kernel
to dump cores when the filter crashes for some reason.  Some modern UNIX
systems suppress core dumps during crashes for security reasons if the
user ID has changed during the lifetime of the process.  Currently only
supported on Linux.

.TP
.I Include (string)
Names a file to be opened and read as an additional configuration file.
Nesting is allowed to a maximum of five levels.

.TP
.I InternalHosts (dataset)
Identifies a set of hosts that identifies clients whose connections
should be treated as "internal" by this filter.  Messages received from
such sources will not be verified and are instead trusted as-is; in
particular, their Authentication-Results fields are trusted to be
correct and authentic, meaning they will be assumed to contain the correct
chain status when generating an outgoing seal.  See the description of
"PeerList" for a description of the supported format.  If no set is
provided, "127.0.0.1" is added to the list by default.

.TP
.I MilterDebug (integer)
Sets the debug level to be requested from the milter library.  The
default is 0.

.TP
.I Mode (string)
Selects the operating mode(s) for this filter.  If the string contains
the character "s", the filter will sign and seal messages passing through
the filter.  If the string contains the character "v", the filter
will do signature and seal validation of arriving messages.  The two
can be combined.  If neither is specified, the operating mode will
be inferred on a per-connection basis based on the entries in the
.I InternalHosts
list; connections from internal hosts will be assigned to signing mode,
and all others will be assigned to verify mode.

.TP
.I OversignHeaders (string)
Specifies a comma-separated list of header field names that should be
included in all signature header lists (the "h=" tag) once more than the
number of times they were actually present in the signed message.  The set
is empty by default.  The purpose of this, and especially of listing an
absent header field, is to prevent the addition of important fields between
the signer and the verifier.  Since the verifier would include that header
field when performing verification if it had been added by an intermediary,
the signed message and the verified message were different and the
verification would fail.  Note that listing a field name here and not listing
it in the
.I SignHeaders
list is likely to generate invalid signatures.

.TP
.I PeerList (dataset)
Identifies a set of "peers" that identifies clients whose connections
should be accepted without processing by this filter.  The set
should contain on each line a hostname, domain name (e.g. ".example.com"),
IP address, an IPv6 address (including an IPv4 mapped address), or a
CIDR-style IP specification (e.g. "192.168.1.0/24").  An entry beginning
with a bang ("!") character means "not", allowing exclusions of specific
hosts that are otherwise members of larger sets.  Host and domain names are 
matched first, then the IP or IPv6 address depending on the connection 
type.  More precise entries are preferred over less precise ones, i.e. 
"192.168.1.1" will match before "!192.168.1.0/24".  The text form of IPv6 
addresses will be forced to lowercase when queried (RFC5952), so the contents
of this data set should also use lowercase.  The IP address portion of an
entry may optionally contain square brackets; both forms (with and without)
will be checked.

.TP
.I PidFile (string)
Specifies the path to a file that should be created at process start
containing the process ID.

.TP
.I SealHeaderChecks (string)
Identifies a file containing header checks that should be done to determine
whether to seal a message.  Each entry in this file must be of the form
"name:regexp".  When this feature is set, messages will only be processed
by the filter if any instance of the named header field exists and has a
value matching the provided regular expression.  If the value of an
instance appears to be a JSON list, then the regular expression is applied
to all strings in the list.

.TP
.I SignatureAlgorithm (string)
Selects the signing algorithm to use when generating signatures.
Use 'openarc \-V' to see the list of supported algorithms.
The default is
.I rsa-sha256.

.TP
.I SignHeaders (string)
Specifies the set of header fields that should be included when generating
signatures.  This is expected to be a comma-separated list of header
field names, and matching is case-insensitive.  If the list omits any header
field that is mandated by the ARC specification, those fields are implicitly
added.  By default, those fields listed in the DKIM specification as
"SHOULD" be signed (RFC6376, Section 5.4) will be signed by the filter.

.TP
.I Socket (string)
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from
.I sendmail(8)
in order to provide service.
.I socketspec
is in one of two forms:
.I local:path,
which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified
.I path,
or
.I inet:port[@host]
or
.I inet6:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified
.I port
and in the specified protocol family.  If the
.I host
is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces.  A literal IP address must be enclosed in
square brackets.  This option is mandatory either in the configuration file or
on the command line.

.TP
.I Syslog (Boolean)
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
any interesting activity.

.TP
.I SyslogFacility (string)
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
using the named facility.  The facility names are the same as the ones
allowed in
.I syslog.conf(5).
The default is "mail".

.TP
.I UMask (integer)
Requests a specific permissions mask to be used for file creation.
This only applies to creation of the socket when
.I Socket
specifies a UNIX domain socket, and to the
.I PidFile
(if any).  See
.I umask(2)
for more information.

.TP
.I UserID (string)
Attempts to become the specified userid before starting operations.
The value is of the form
.I userid[:group].
The process will be assigned all of the groups and primary group ID of
the named
.I userid
unless an alternate
.I group
is specified.

.SH NOTES
Features that involve specification of IPv4 addresses or CIDR blocks
will use the
.I inet_addr(3) 
function to parse that information.  Users should be familiar with the
way that function handles the non-trivial cases (for example, "192.0.2/24"    
and "192.0.2.0/24" are not the same thing).
