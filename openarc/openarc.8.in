.SH DESCRIPTION
.B openarc
implements the proposed
.B ARC
(Authenticated Received Chain) standard for confirming handling and
authentication of a message as it is handled for delivery.

.B openarc
uses the
.I milter
interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of
.B sendmail(8),
to provide ARC signing and/or verifying service for mail transiting
a milter-aware MTA.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-b modes
Selects operating modes.
.I modes
is a concatenation of characters that indicate which mode(s) of operation
are desired.  Valid modes are
.I s
(signer) and
.I v
(verifier).  The default is
.I sv.
.TP
.I \-c configfile
Read the named configuration file.  See the
.I openarc.conf(5)
man page for details.  Values in the configuration file are overridden
when their equivalents are provided on the command line until a configuration
reload occurs.  The default is to read a configuration file from
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/openarc.conf
if one exists, or otherwise to apply defaults to all values.
.TP
.I \-f
Normally
.I openarc
forks and exits immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
This flag suppresses that behaviour so that it runs in the foreground.
.TP
.I \-n
Parse the configuration file and command line arguments, reporting any
errors found, and then exit.  The exit value will be 0 if the filter would
start up without complaint, or non-zero otherwise.
.TP
.I \-p socketspec
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from
.I sendmail(8)
in order to provide service.
.I socketspec
is in one of two forms:
.I local:path
which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified
.I path,
or
.I inet:port[@host]
or
.I inet6:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified
.I port
using the requested protocol family.  If the
.I host
is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces.  A literal IP address must be enclosed in
square brackets.  If neither socket type is specified,
.I local
is assumed, meaning the parameter is interpreted as a path at which
the socket should be created.  This parameter is mandatory either here or
in the configuration file.
.TP
.I \-P pidfile
Specifies a file into which the filter should write its process ID at startup.
.TP
.I \-u userid[:group]
Attempts to be come the specified
.I userid
before starting operations.  The process will be assigned all of the groups
and primary group ID of the named
.I userid
unless an alternate
.I group
is specified.  See the FILE PERMISSIONS section for more information.
.TP
.I \-V
Print the version number and build-time options, and then exit without
doing anything else.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Filter exit status codes are selected according to
.I sysexits(3).
.SH VERSION
This man page covers version @VERSION@ of
.I openarc.
